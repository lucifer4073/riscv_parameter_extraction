- name: cache_block_size
  description: Size of a contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations within a cache.
  type: Integer
  source_quote: The size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system.
  rationale: This parameter is architecturally significant as it allows software to discover information about cache organization
    and capacity in the system.
  scope: System-wide
- name: cache_capacity
  description: Total storage capacity of a cache, including both data and other metadata.
  type: Integer
  source_quote: The capacity and organization of a cache... are both implementation-specific.
  rationale: This parameter is architecturally significant as it allows software to discover information about the caches
    in a system.
  scope: System-wide
- name: cache_block_id
  description: Identification method for cache blocks, where any physical address corresponding to underlying memory locations
    can be used.
  type: String
  source_quote: A cache block is identified by any of the physical addresses corresponding to the underlying memory locations.
  rationale: This parameter is architecturally significant as it provides a means for software to discover information about
    cache organization and capacity in the system.
  scope: System-wide
- name: cmo_cache_uniformity
  description: Whether or not the size of a cache block is uniform throughout the system, initially set by CMO extensions.
  type: Boolean
  source_quote: In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system.
  rationale: This parameter is architecturally significant as it allows software to discover information about cache organization
    and capacity in the system.
  scope: System-wide
