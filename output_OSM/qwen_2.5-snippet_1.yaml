- name: cache_block_size
  description: Size of each cache block in bytes
  type: Integer
  source_quote: The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific, and
    the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system.
    In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system.
  rationale: The cache block size is architecturally significant as it affects memory access patterns and performance.
  scope: Per-cache
  constraints: Must be a power-of-two value
  possible_values:
  - 64
  - 128
  - 256
  - 512
- name: cache_capacity
  description: Total capacity of the cache in bytes
  type: Integer
  source_quote: The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific, and
    the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system.
  rationale: Cache capacity affects overall memory performance and is crucial for understanding cache behavior.
  scope: System-wide
- name: cache_alignment
  description: Alignment requirement for cache blocks
  type: String
  source_quote: A cache block is identified by any of the physical addresses corresponding to the underlying memory locations.
    The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific, and the execution
    environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system.
  rationale: Alignment requirements impact how data is stored and accessed within the cache.
  scope: System-wide
  possible_values:
  - 32
  - 64
  - 128
- name: cache_unified_size
  description: Uniform size of all cache blocks in a system as mandated by CMO extensions
  type: Boolean
  source_quote: In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system.
  rationale: Ensures consistency across the system and simplifies certain architectural designs.
  scope: System-wide
