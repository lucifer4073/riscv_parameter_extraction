- name: cache_capacity
  description: The total storage capacity of a cache in the system
  type: Integer
  unit: bytes
  source_quote: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"
  rationale: The specification explicitly states that cache capacity is implementation-specific, meaning implementers can choose different cache sizes
  constraints: Must be a positive integer value
  scope: Per cache instance in the system
  
- name: cache_organization
  description: The organizational structure of the cache (e.g., direct-mapped, set-associative, fully-associative)
  type: Enum
  possible_values:
    - direct_mapped
    - set_associative
    - fully_associative
    - other_implementation_specific
  source_quote: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"
  rationale: Cache organization is explicitly marked as implementation-specific, allowing various cache architectures
  scope: Per cache instance in the system
  
- name: cache_block_size
  description: The size of a single cache block (cache line) in bytes
  type: Integer
  unit: bytes
  source_quote: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"
  rationale: Cache block size is implementation-specific, though it must be uniform throughout the system
  constraints:
    - Must be a power of two
    - Must be naturally aligned
    - Must be uniform throughout the system (as per specification requirement)
  scope: System-wide (uniform across all caches)
  additional_requirements: "In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system"
  
- name: cache_block_alignment
  description: The alignment requirement for cache blocks in memory
  type: String
  value: naturally_aligned_power_of_two_or_napot
  source_quote: "each of which represents a contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations"
  rationale: The specification indicates cache blocks can be either naturally aligned power-of-two or NAPOT (Naturally Aligned Power Of Two), giving implementers flexibility in alignment strategy
  constraints: Must be either naturally aligned power-of-two or NAPOT
  scope: System-wide
  
- name: cache_discovery_mechanism
  description: The method by which the execution environment provides software information about caches and cache blocks
  type: Implementation_Specific_Interface
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system"
  rationale: While discovery must be provided, the specific mechanism is not specified and is left to the implementation
  constraints: Must provide a way for software to discover cache capacity, organization, and block size
  scope: System-wide
  interface_type: Execution environment dependent
  
- name: number_of_cache_levels
  description: The number of cache hierarchy levels present in the system
  type: Integer
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system"
  rationale: The use of plural "caches" implies multiple caches may exist, and the number is implementation-specific
  constraints: Must be at least 0 (system may have no caches), typically 1-3 in practice
  scope: System-wide
  
- name: cache_topology
  description: The hierarchical arrangement and sharing of caches among cores/harts
  type: Implementation_Specific_Structure
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system"
  rationale: Multiple caches implies a topology (private L1, shared L2, etc.) which must be discoverable but is not specified by the ISA
  constraints: Must be discoverable through the execution environment interface
  scope: System-wide
  properties:
    - cache_sharing_domain
    - cache_inclusion_policy
    - cache_coherence_protocol
