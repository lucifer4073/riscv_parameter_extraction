  description: The actual number of CSRs implemented out of the 4,096 possible CSR encodings
  type: Integer
  unit: count
  source_quote: "The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0]) for up to 4,096 CSRs"
  rationale: The specification provides space for "up to 4,096 CSRs", implying implementations may use fewer than the maximum
  constraints:
    min: 0
    max: 4096
  scope: Per implementation
  properties:
    address_range: "0x000 to 0xFFF"

  description: The specific set of CSR addresses that are actually implemented in the system
  type: Address_Set
  source_quote: "The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0]) for up to 4,096 CSRs"
  rationale: The phrase "up to 4,096" indicates implementations choose which subset of CSRs to implement
  constraints:
    - Must be valid 12-bit addresses (0x000-0xFFF)
    - Must respect conventional accessibility encoding in csr[11:8]

- name: csr_read_write_accessibility_convention_adherence
  description: Whether the implementation follows the conventional CSR address mapping for read/write accessibility
  type: Boolean
  source_quote: "By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write accessibility"
  rationale: The use of "by convention" suggests this is a recommended practice but not strictly mandated, allowing implementation flexibility
  default_value: true
  scope: Per implementation
  note: "Convention suggests csr[11:10] encode R/W vs RO, and csr[9:8] encode minimum privilege level"

  source_quote: "The top two bits (csr[11:10]) indicate whether the register is read/write (00,01, or 10) or read-only (11)"

  type: Address_Range_Set
  source_quote: "The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0]) for up to 4,096 CSRs"
  rationale: While standard CSRs have defined addresses, implementations may allocate custom CSRs in unused portions of the address space

    - Must not conflict with standard CSR addresses
    - Should follow conventional accessibility encoding
    - Total addresses limited to 4,096
