- name: cache_capacity
  description: The total data storage size of the cache.
  type: Integer (Bytes)
  source_quote: "The capacity ... of a cache ... [is] implementation-specific"
  trigger_category: Explicit Flexibility 

- name: cache_organization
  description: The internal structural design of the cache (e.g., associativity, set-mapping strategy).
  type: String / Enum
  source_quote: "The ... organization of a cache ... [is] implementation-specific"

- name: cache_block_size
  description: The size of the contiguous memory range represented by a single cache block.
  type: Integer (Bytes)
  source_quote: "the size of a cache block ... [is] implementation-specific"
  constraints: 
    - "Must be a naturally aligned power-of-two (NAPOT) range"
    - "In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system"

- name: cache_discovery_mechanism
  description: The specific method or interface provided by the execution environment that allows software to query cache properties.
  type: Interface / Mechanism
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches"
  trigger_category: General Discretion (Implied by "provides a means") 

- name: cmo_system_wide_uniformity
  description: Defines whether cache block sizes are consistent across the entire system hierarchy. While mandated for initial CMOs, this implies an architectural parameter for future or non-CMO configurations.
  type: Boolean
  source_quote: "In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system."
