  source_quote: "A cache block is identified by any of the physical addresses corresponding to the underlying memory locations"

- name: cache_discovery_mechanism
  description: Mechanism provided by the execution environment that allows software to discover cache and cache-block information.
  type: String
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system"
