- name: cache_capacity
  description: The storage capacity of each individual cache in the system.
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  variability: per_cache
  source_quote: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"
  notes: Different caches may have different capacities.

- name: cache_organization
  description: The structural organization of each individual cache (e.g., associativity, replacement policy, or other internal structuring).
  type: string
  variability: per_cache
  source_quote: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"
  notes: Different caches may have different organizations.

- name: cache_block_size
  description: The size of a cache block, which must be the same for all caches in the system under the initial CMO extensions.
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  constraints:
    uniform_across_system: true
    alignment: naturally_aligned
    contiguous: true
  source_quote: "the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific and In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system."
  notes: Size is implementation-chosen but required to be uniform.

- name: cache_block_range_representation
  description: Whether a cache block represents a strictly power-of-two range or a NAPOT (naturally aligned power-of-two) range of memory locations.
  type: enum
  possible_values:
    - power_of_two
    - napot
  source_quote: "contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations"
  notes: The parenthetical "or NAPOT" indicates implementers may choose either representation.

- name: cache_information_discovery_mechanism
  description: The mechanism provided by the execution environment for software to discover details about caches and cache blocks (including capacity, organization, block size, etc.).
  type: implementation_defined
  required: true
  source_quote: "the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system."
  notes: The existence of a discovery mechanism is required, but its form is left entirely to the implementation.
