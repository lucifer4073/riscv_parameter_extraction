- name: csr_address_width
  description: The number of bits used to encode the CSR address in CSR-access instructions.
  type: integer
  value: 12
  source_quote: "a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0])"
  notes: This is fixed by the ISA, providing a maximum addressable space.

- name: max_possible_csrs
  description: The maximum number of distinct CSRs that can be addressed using the allocated encoding space.
  type: integer
  value: 4096
  source_quote: "up to 4,096 CSRs"
  notes: Implementations may support fewer than this maximum; the "up to" indicates the implemented count is at the discretion of the implementer.

- name: follow_conventional_accessibility_encoding
  description: Whether the implementation adheres to the convention of using the upper 4 bits of the CSR address to encode read/write accessibility and minimum privilege level.
  type: boolean
  source_quote: "By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write accessibility of the CSRs according to privilege level as shown in Table 1."
  notes: The use of "by convention" indicates this encoding is recommended but not strictly mandated by the ISA, allowing potential alternative accessibility mechanisms.

- name: rw_access_bit_patterns
  description: The bit patterns in csr[11:10] that designate a CSR as read/write under the conventional encoding.
  type: enum_set
  possible_values:
    - "00"
    - "01"
    - "10"
  source_quote: "whether the register is read/write (00,01, or 10)"
  notes: The provision of three distinct patterns for read/write (instead of one) provides implementers flexibility in selecting which pattern to use for a given read/write CSR, potentially for categorization or extension purposes.

- name: ro_access_bit_pattern
  description: The bit pattern in csr[11:10] that designates a CSR as read-only under the conventional encoding.
  type: string
  value: "11"
  source_quote: "read-only (11)"
  notes: Fixed value under the convention for read-only CSRs.

- name: privilege_level_encoding_bits
  description: The bit field in the CSR address used to encode the lowest privilege level permitted to access the CSR under the conventional scheme.
  type: bit_range
  bits: csr[9:8]
  source_quote: "The next two bits (csr[9:8]) encode the lowest privilege level that can access the CSR."
  notes: Part of the conventional encoding; the exact mapping of values to specific privilege modes is detailed in Table 1 (not provided here), but the use of these specific bits is conventional rather than mandatory.
