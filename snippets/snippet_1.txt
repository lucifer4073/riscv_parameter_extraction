Caches organize copies of data into cache blocks, each of which represents a contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations. A cache block is identified by any of the physical addresses corresponding to the underlying memory locations. The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific, and the execution environment provides software a means to discover information about the caches and cache blocks in a system. In the initial set of CMO extensions, the size of a cache block shall be uniform throughout the system.
