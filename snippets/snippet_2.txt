"Conventional" R/W accessibility of CSRs according to address mapping 
The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0]) for up to 4,096 CSRs. By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write accessibility of the CSRs according to privilege level as shown in Table 1. The top two bits (csr[11:10]) indicate whether the register is read/write (00,01, or 10) or read-only (11). The next two bits (csr[9:8]) encode the lowest privilege level that can access the CSR.
